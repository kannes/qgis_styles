# QGIS styles
Collection of resources to take your QGIS cartography to the nextest level.

Styles are created with QGIS 3.12, but some of them should work also on older versions of QGIS if you modfiy the XML by hand and change the *qgis_style* version on top of the file to **1**. 

## Available Styles
### Trees on the beach
For polygons.

You can also use [QGIS Resource Sharing plugin](http://qgis-contribution.github.io/QGIS-ResourceSharing/author/repository-structure.html)

Most of the styles work with any polygon layer and you can try them out for example with [Natural Earth data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
